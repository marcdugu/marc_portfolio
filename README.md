# ðŸš€ Distinguishing Cosmic String Signal Peaks from Background Noise in Gravitational-Wave Data Using a Neural Network

## ðŸ“Œ Abstract
Detecting gravitational waves from cosmic strings remains a challenge due to background noise resembling actual signals. This project employs a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with seven convolutional layers and three fully connected layers to classify cosmic string signals versus background noise. Trained on simulated data mimicking the Einstein Telescopeâ€™s potential detections, the model achieved a **95% accuracy**. These results demonstrate the potential of deep learning in improving cosmic string detection, paving the way for future advancements in astrophysical signal processing.
